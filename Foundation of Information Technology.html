  <h2> FOUNDATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY </h2>
  <h3> Understanding the Scope of Information Technology </h3>
  <p> Hardware and Software Development: Designing and managing computer systems.
Networking and Communication: Setting up and maintaining networks for data sharing.
Data Management: Organizing, analyzing, and ensuring the security of digital information.
IT Services: Technical support, system administration, and consulting. </p>

  <h3> IT's Relationship with Other Fields in Computing </h3>
  <p> IT interconnects with other fields of computing, such as:
  <ul>
    <li>  Computer Science: While IT applies existing technologies, computer science focuses on developing algorithms, programming languages, and innovations that IT later employs. </li>
    <li> Information Systems: This field studies how IT can be effectively integrated into business operations to meet organizational goals. </li>
    <li> Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning: IT supports these areas through data processing, storage, and deployment of intelligent systems. </li>
    <li> Cybersecurity: IT ensures the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of data by employing techniques and technologies developed in cybersecurity. </li> 
  </ul>	
  <p>

  <h3> Data, Information, and Knowledge </h3> 
  <p> <ul>
    <li> Data: Raw, unprocessed facts and figures (e.g., numbers, symbols). </li>
    <li> Information: Processed and organized data that has meaning and context (e.g., sales figures showing trends over time). </li>
    <li> Knowledge: The application of information, combined with experience and insight, to make decisions or solve problems. </li>
	</ul>
Understanding the distinctions and connections among these three helps in appreciating how IT transforms data into actionable knowledge. </p>
